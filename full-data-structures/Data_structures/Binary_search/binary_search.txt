Binary Search is an efficient searching algorithm that works on sorted arrays.

Instead of checking elements one by one (like linear search), it repeatedly divides the search range by 2.

This makes it much faster than linear search for large datasets.

ðŸ”Ž How it works (Step-by-Step)

Suppose we want to search for 8 in [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12].

Start with the whole array
left = 0, right = arr.length - 1

Find the middle element
mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2)
â†’ Check if arr[mid] === target.

Compare target with middle

If target === arr[mid], âœ… found.

If target < arr[mid], search the left half.

If target > arr[mid], search the right half.

Repeat until found or left > right.
