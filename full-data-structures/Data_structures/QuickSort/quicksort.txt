-Its a divide and conquer

How it Works:
 - Choosing a pivot element from an arrays
 - Partitioning the array into two parts 
        . Element smaller than (or equal to) the pivot
        . Elements greater than the pivot

 - recursively sorting the two partions
 - Average time complexity O(n log n)
 - Worst case: O(n^2) 
 - Space complexity: O(log n) due to recursion stack
