Linear Search is the simplest searching algorithm.

You go through each element in the array one by one.

If the element matches the target (the one you’re searching for), return its index.

If you reach the end and don’t find it, return -1 (meaning not found).


⏱ Time Complexity

Best case: O(1)
If the element is the very first one, we stop immediately.

Worst case: O(n)
If the element is at the end or not present at all, we check every element.

Average case: O(n)
On average, we’ll check about half the elements, but constants don’t matter in Big-O → so O(n).


Summary:

Time complexity:

Best: O(1)

Worst: O(n)

Average: O(n)

Space complexity: O(1)
