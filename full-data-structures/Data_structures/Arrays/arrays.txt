They organize data sequatially
They are stored in contigous memory - That menas they are stored in order
lookup(access) = O(1);
Push = O(1);
Insert = O(n);
delete = O(n);

Types of arrays
- Static Arrays - They are fixed in size.
- Dynamic arrays - Allow us to copy and rebuild an array at a new location with more memory is we wanted more memory.
    - lookup = O(1);
    - Append* = O(1); can be O(n) sometimes
    - insert = O(n);
    - Delete = O(n);
- JS automatically uses Dynamic array



Objects
