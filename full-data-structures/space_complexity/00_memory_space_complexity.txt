A good as far as we have covered should have the following things:
1. Readable
2. Scalable.

However under being Scalable we actually look at 2 things:
 - Speed - which we have covered with Big o(Time complexity)
 - Memory - We need to use small space while creating programs(Space complexity)

 we will cover space complexity:
 has two main things:
 Heap - where we keep our variable that we assign
 stack - Where we track our function calls
   what causes space complexity?
    - variable
    - Data Structures
    - Function calls
    - Allocations
