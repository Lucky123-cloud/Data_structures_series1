# Write a function isBalanacedParentheses that gets a string of parentheses, brackets, and braces and returns True if the string is balanced, otherwise False.

# That is, every opening symbol must have a corresponding closing symbol

# Use stack to solve this problem! To solve this you will need to make an adjustment to your stack to store characters instead of integers.

 

# Examples:

# Input: "({[]})"

# Output: True

 

# Input: "({[)})]"

# Output: False
