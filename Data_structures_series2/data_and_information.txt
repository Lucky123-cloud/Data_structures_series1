what is Data? --- Dictionary definition: 
The quantities, characters or symbols on 
which operations are performed by a computer, 
which may be stored and transmitted in the form 
of electrical signals and recorded on magnetic, 
optical or mechanical recording medi.

When does data become information? ---- If data is arranged in a systematic way then it gets a structure
and become meaningful



To provide an appropriate way to structure the data, we need to know about DATA structure

DATA STRUCTURE - Is the systematic way to organize data so that it can be used efficiently.
Examples: Arrays

Real data Sctructure defination:
    Data structure is used to implement an ADT
Which Data Structure to Use in an ADT:
    1. Save space
    2. Saves Time

    The one that the user wants to use if he needs time or space

REAL LIFE EXAMPLES OF DATA SCTRUCTURE
1.Stack is used undo and redo
2.Array is used to store bitmap images(bitmap images are stored as a 
    series of tiny dots called pixels.)
3. Graph is used to store friends information in social Media

Conclusion:

ADT provides Abstarction, The user does not need to know what is going on in the background

ADVANTAGES OF DATA SCTRUCTURE
1. efficiency - proper choice of data sctructures make program efficient in terms of space and time
2. Reusability - one implemenation can be used by multiple client programs
3. Abstarction - Data sctructure provided by an ADT which provides a level of abstarction. The client program does not have worry about the implemenation details
