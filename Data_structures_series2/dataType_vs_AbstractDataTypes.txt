What is a Data Types?

Two important things about data types:
    1. Defines a certain domain if values.
    2. Defines Operations allowed on those values


What is a user defined Data Type?
In constrast to primitive data types, there is a concept of user data types.
The opeartions and values of user defined data types are not specified in the language itself but by the user
Example: Structure, union and enumaration


Abstract Data Types(ADT):
Are like user defined data types which defines operations on values
 using functions without specifying what 
is there inside the function and how the operations are performed

There are multiple ways to implement ADT, eg arrays, linked list
The program which uses data structure is called a client program
It has access to ADT ie Interface

The program which implements the data structure is known as the implemenation
