Types of Data Structures:
    1. Linear Data Structures
    2. Non-linear Data Structures
    3. Static Data Structures
    4. Dynamic Data structures


Linear data Structure
- A data structure is linear when all the elements are arranged in a linear order(sequantial)
- Examples are Stacks, Arrays, Queue, Linked Lists
-When each element in a data structre has one predessocor and one successor



Non-linear data Structures
- A data structure is non-linear when all the elemnts are not arranged in a linear(sequantial) order. There is no linear arrangements of the elements
-Examples are graph and tree

Static Data structures
-Memory allocated at compile time, therefore maximum size is fixed.
-Advantage: Access Data fast
-Disadvantage: slower insertion and deletion


Dynamic data Structure
-Memory allocated at run time, therefore maximum size is flexible
-advantage: Faster insertion and deletion
-Disadvantage: Slower access
